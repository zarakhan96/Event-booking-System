To set up the project, start by downloading the project files.
You can either clone the repository from GitHub or download the
project zip file and extract it to your local machine. Once you
have the files, open Visual Studio Code (VS Code), launch the
application, and open the entire project folder by navigating 
to File > Open Folder.

To run the project, locate and open the index.html file in the
VS Code sidebar. You can view the events by clicking on any event
you'd like to see the details of, and use the booking form to
explore the booking seats feature. To ensure the site is responsive
use VS Code's built-in preview or open the website in different
browsers and devices for testing.
